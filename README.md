# Traffic Sign Detection and Recognition System
> This project emphasizes on the segmentation of traffic sign images based on the Chinese Traffic Sign Database (CTSD). The classification model is based on the SVM classifier trained with HOG and color features.

## General Information
Source code for the whole project is available in the main.ipynb file, including the segmentation and classification model.
The color of traffic sign and category (0 - 57) would be classified based on the input image.
